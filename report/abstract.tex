\ Sudoku is a popular number-based puzzle game that requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills. In this report, an approach to solve Sudoku puzzles is proposed. The proposed method consists of two main steps: \textit{Image Processing} and \textit{Machine Learning}. In the first step,image processing techniques are used to extract the Sudoku puzzle grid from a given image. Afterwards, the image was split into 81 boxes thereby extracting image of each digit. Then, a CNN model was used to detect digits from each box. The CNN model showed an accuracy of \textbf{98.25} on the validation data. Once the digits were recognized, the puzzle was solved using backtracking algorithm.
The solution was then overlaid on top of the source image.
