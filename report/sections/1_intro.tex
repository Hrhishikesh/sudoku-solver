\section{Introduction}
Sudoku puzzles have gained immense popularity over the years as a fun and challenging way to test one's logic and problem-solving skills. The rules of Sudoku are simple: fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without any repetition. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing automated techniques for solving Sudoku puzzles using computer vision and machine learning.

This project explores the use of image processing and machine learning to solve Sudoku puzzles with an end-to-end pipeline that takes an image of a Sudoku puzzle as input and outputs the solution, all while overlaying the output on top of the original image. The system utilizes various Image Processing Techniques to extract the Sudoku grid from the image and individual cells from the grid, and a Convolutional Neural Network is used to solve the puzzle. The result is a system that can solve Sudoku puzzles in a matter of seconds, providing a fast and efficient way to tackle this classic logic problem..
